# Reworking Sol by K.N.Marshall (2025)

## Project Overview

This project commenced in 2025 after the completion of the Deakin Honours program in Creative Arts. It seeks to tie directly into my previous photography output, hoping to expand and explore notions of non-consumptive, random generative, and guerilla art.

Inspired by Sol LeWitt's original Wall Drawings series, this project explores the use of creative coding using simple FOSS software. The goal is to create digital artworks that adhere to LeWitt's various instructions for the Wall Drawing series, connecting my early art to a new medium of digital creation.

## Tools and Libraries

The Python scripts created for this project utilize the following libraries:
- `matplotlib`
- `mpl_toolkits`
- `pickle`

## Contribution and Feedback

I would love to see these artworks displayed elsewhere. Please get in contact if you have any questions, ideas, or positive feedback! Contributions to improve the scripts and explore new generative art concepts are welcome.
