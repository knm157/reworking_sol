Sol LeWitt. Wall Drawing 

123: Copied lines: The first draftsman draws a not straight vertical line as long as possible. The second draftsman draws a line next to the first one, trying to copy it. The third draftsman does the same, as do as many draftsmen as possible. Then the first draftsman, followed by the others,copies the last line drawn until both ends of the wall are reached. March 1972. Black pencil. 123 was realized in two versions there:as 123, in graphite on a white ground; and, as 123A, in white crayon on a black ground.
