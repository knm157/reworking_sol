# **Sol LeWitt Drawings - March 21, 2025**

## ** Summary of Today's Work**

Today, we worked on implementing **Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings** in Python using Matplotlib and SVG output.
We focused on the following:
- **Wall Drawing #118** (Randomized point connections in 2D and 3D)
- **Wall Drawing #49** (15-section grid with defined line orientations)
- **Wall Drawing #86** (10,000 randomized lines in a defined space with animation)

Each drawing was developed with **custom user input**, high-resolution **PNG and SVG outputs**, and **exporting data for CNC or physical implementations**.

---

## **Wall Drawing #118 - 2D**
### **2D Version**
âœ… **User-defined number of points (default: 50)**
âœ… **Auto-incrementing filenames** for PNG, SVG, and text file
âœ… **Randomly placed points connected to each other**
âœ… **Stored X, Y coordinates in a `.txt` file**
âœ… **Saved PNG in `./drawings/`, SVG in `./svg/`, text in `./points/`**

Prompts given as such:
{
Please review the following python code for Wall Drawing 118: <118\_hi\_res.002.py>

Please adapt the code so that it:

The user is asked via the terminal to input the number of random point, set the default to 50.

Auto saves on running creating a new incremented file, using the file name "wall_drawing_118_001.png" in a folder called ./drawings/

>  Output as 118.003.py

Please add the SVG output into a directory under ./drawings/svg/ each time the program is run.

> Output as 118.004.py Working as expected!
}


## **Wall Drawing #118 - 3D Implementation**

### **3D Version**
âœ… **User-defined 3D space size (default: 1mÂ³)**
âœ… **Stored 3D coordinates and allowed virtual exploration**
âœ… **Auto-incremented `.txt` file of 3D points**
âœ… **Interactive visualization using `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`**
âœ… **Option to reload and visualize previously saved 3D drawings**

ðŸ“‚ Example Output Files:
```
drawings/
  â”œâ”€â”€ wall_drawing_118_001.png
  â”œâ”€â”€ wall_drawing_118_002.png
svg/
  â”œâ”€â”€ wall_drawing_118_001.svg
  â”œâ”€â”€ wall_drawing_118_002.svg
points/
  â”œâ”€â”€ wall_drawing_118_001.txt
  â”œâ”€â”€ wall_drawing_118_002.txt
```

Prompts as follows 
{
Can you adapt the program to output the point into 3d space using matplotlib? can you make it so that the user can move the model around and explore it with a mouse pointer by dragging?  so that each 'drawing' can be seen in the virtual space.

We will save the program to 118_3d.py

The 3d program should take user input for the 3d plot size in metres, and default to a 1m cube, but allow it to be scaled much larger. 

The program should save the x,y,z points in a incremental saved text file, allowing a physical implementation of the placement of the point as an object and allowing the artist to run threads between the points.
}

Output as 118_3d_001.py

{is it possible to save each runs output of matplotlib 3d plot so it can be reopened by the user?}

Yes! You can save and reload each 3D plot so users can view previous runs later.
ðŸ”¹ How to Save and Reopen 3D Plots

âœ… Save the figure as a .fig.pickle file (Matplotlibâ€™s way to store figures).
âœ… Allow users to reload and view previous 3D plots interactively.
âœ… Save auto-incremented filenames so multiple runs are preserved.

Output as 118_3d.002.py

## **ðŸŽ¨ Wall Drawing #49 - 15-Part Grid with Lines & Colors**
âœ… **User-defined colors for each line set** (default: Black, Yellow, Red, Blue)  
âœ… **Custom width & height of the plot in millimeters**
âœ… **Generated 15 equal vertical sections, each following Sol LeWitt's prescribed line combinations**
âœ… **High-resolution PNG output for print & CNC use**
âœ… **Optional SVG vector export for laser cutting or further design modifications**

ðŸ“‚ Example Output:
```
drawings/
  â”œâ”€â”€ wall_drawing_49.png
svg/
  â”œâ”€â”€ wall_drawing_49.svg
```

Lets move on to another one of Sol Lewitt's works -  Wall Drawing #49

Sol's instruction where:

"A wall divided vertically into fifteen equal parts, each with a different line direction and color, and all combinations. Red, Yellow, Blue, Black Pencil."

there is a diagram which shows the formatting of each part: 

Space 1: Black vertical lines
Space 2: Yellow horizontal lines
Space 3: Red diagonal lines at 45 degree, going from bottom on the left to high on the right.
Space 4: Blue diagonal lines at 45 degree, going from high on the left to low on the right.

The wall then combines these as:

Space 5: 1 & 2
Space 6: 1 & 3
Space 7: 1 & 4
Space 8: 2 & 3
Space 9: 2 & 4
Space 10: 3 & 4
Space 11: 1 & 2 & 3
Space 12: 1 & 2 & 4
Space 13: 1 & 3 & 4
Space 14: 2 & 3 & 4 
Space 15: 1 & 2 & 3 & 4

Please make it so that a user can input a color change for each of the four colors as they run the program, an ability to set the height and width. 
}

Output as 49.py doesn't work as yet, requires major reworking seemingly.

## **ðŸŽ¨ Wall Drawing #86 - Randomized Lines**
âœ… **User-defined plot height & width (default: 2m x 5m)**
âœ… **User-defined number of lines (default: 10,000)**
âœ… **Each line randomly placed and oriented (0Â°-360Â°)**
âœ… **Lines saved in `.txt` file with positions and angles**
âœ… **High-resolution `.png` and `.svg` output**
âœ… **Animated line-drawing effect to build up the visualization**
âœ… **Auto-incremented filenames prevent overwriting**

ðŸ“‚ Example Output Files:
```
drawings/
  â”œâ”€â”€ 86_001_2m_5m_10000.png
svg/
  â”œâ”€â”€ 86_001_2m_5m_10000.svg
points/
  â”œâ”€â”€ 86_001_2m_5m_10000.txt
```

## **ðŸ”¹ Next Steps & Enhancements**
ðŸš€ **Future improvements to consider:**
1. **G-code export** for direct CNC compatibility
2. **SVG layering based on angle or color variation**
3. **Multi-threading for improved performance in large drawings**
4. **Real-time animation controls for interactive drawing**
5. **Export to `.dxf` for laser cutting or CAD work**
6. **Option to save drawings in `.stl` or `.obj` format for 3D printing**

Let's move onto Wall Drawing #86 

Drawing #86's matplotlib plot should default to a 2m height by 5m width, and randomly plot the 10,000 lines at a random angle between 0-360 degrees), line length should default to 254mm, and I would like the user to input the number of lines, default this to 10000.

I need user input for the height and width of the plot, number of lines, line length,  the program should then randomly across the plot place number of lines and please remember to output all files in the following way : 
increment each file name 86_001_<height>_<width>_<num>.png from teh user input.

a .png visual matplotlib file to './drawings.'  

an SVG in ./svg/ to allow for CNC

a text file of each points x,y position and the angle direction in degrees(0-360) to './points' please include the user supplied data into a text block at the top of the file, It should read something like

####
#Wall Drawing matplotlib <name of file>.png
#
# User input was Height(m): <height in m>, Width(m): <width in m>, Number of points: <Number>
#
#
x, y, degrees


Is it possible to animate the plotting of each line in the space? so that each run of the loop as it plots a line  the wall drawing builds up?

I get the following error:

TypeError: '5.0m' is not a valid value for attribute 'width' at svg-element <svg>.

}

Response:

ðŸ”¹ Understanding the Error

The error occurs because SVGwrite expects the size attribute to be a valid SVG length (like "500mm" or "100%"), but we passed a string with "m" (meters), which SVG does not support directly.
ðŸ”¹ Fix

Since SVGwrite expects size values in absolute units (e.g., mm, cm, px), we need to convert meters to millimeters before passing them into svgwrite.Drawing().

Output as 86_002.py
